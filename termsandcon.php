  <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
  <p>
  The renter must meet the minimum age requirement (usually 21 or 25 years old) and possess a valid driver's license at the time of rental.
  A reservation is typically required to secure a rental vehicle. The rental company may require a deposit or credit card authorization to confirm the reservation.
  </p>
  <p>
  The agreement specifies the start and end dates of the rental period. The renter is responsible for returning the vehicle by the agreed-upon date and time. Late returns may incur additional charges.
  The rental rates are determined based on factors such as the type of vehicle, rental duration, and any additional services requested. Payment is usually made at the time of vehicle pickup, and a credit card is typically required to cover the rental charges and any security deposit.

  </p>
  <p> The renter is responsible for ensuring that the rental vehicle is adequately insured. The rental company may offer various insurance options, including collision damage waiver (CDW) and supplemental liability insurance (SLI). The terms and coverage details will be outlined in the agreement.</p>
  <p>The fuel policy will be specified in the agreement. It may require the renter to return the vehicle with a full tank of fuel or allow for a pre-paid fuel option. Failure to comply with the fuel policy may result in additional charges.</p>
  <p>If the renter wishes to extend the rental period, they should contact the rental company in advance. Failure to return the vehicle on time without prior notification may lead to late fees and even legal consequences.</p>
  <p>The renter is responsible for returning the vehicle in the same condition as when rented, with normal wear and tear expected. Any damage beyond normal wear may be subject to repair charges. The renter should inspect the vehicle before driving off and report any existing damage to the rental company.</p>
  
  
  <p>The agreement will specify prohibited uses of the rental vehicle, such as off-road driving, racing, towing, or transporting illegal substances. Violating these terms may result in the termination of the rental agreement and additional charges.</p>
